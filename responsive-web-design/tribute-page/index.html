                John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State
                (now Free State Province in South Africa), which was later annexed by the British Empire, to
                Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, née Suffield (1870–1904).
                The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British
                bank for which he booksed. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien,
                who was born on 17 February 1894. At age four Tolkien, with his mother and younger brother,
                settled near Birmingham, England, after his father die in South Africa.

            In 1900 his mother converted to Roman Catholicism, a faith her elder son also practiced devoutly.
            On her death in 1904, her boys became wards of a Catholic priest. Four years later Tolkien fell in love with another
            orphan, Edith Bratt, who would inspire his fictional character Lúthien Tinúviel. His guardian, however,
            disapproved, and not until his 21st birthday could Tolkien ask Edith to marry him. In the meantime, he
            attended King Edward’s School in Birmingham and Exeter College, Oxford (B.A., 1915; M.A., 1919). During
            World War I he saw action in the Somme. After the Armistice he was briefly on the staff of
            The Oxford English Dictionary (then called The New English Dictionary).

            For most of his adult life, he taught English language and literature, specializing in Old and Middle English,
            at the Universities of Leeds (1920–25) and Oxford (1925–59). Often busy with academic duties and also acting
            as an examiner for other universities, he produced few but influential scholarly publications, notably a
            standard edition of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (1925; with E.V. Gordon) and a landmark lecture on
            Beowulf (Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics, 1936). Tolkien had completed a translation of Beowulf in
            1926, and it was posthumously published, along with classroom lectures he had given on the subject, some of his
            notes, and an original short story inspired by the legend, as Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary (2014).
            He also published an edition of the Ancrene Wisse (1962). During his time at Oxford, Tolkien wrote
            The Hobbit (1937) and the The Lord of the Rings (1954). The Lord of the Rings became immensely popular in the 1960s
            and has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the 20th century,
            judged by both sales and reader surveys.

            The Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917 – 22 January 2003),
            Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 – 27 February 1984), Christopher John Reuel Tolkien
            (21 November 1924 – 15 January 2020) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (born 18 June 1929). On 29 November
            1971, Edith Tolkien died at the age of 82. Tolkien had the name Lúthien engraved on Edith's tombstone at
            Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford. When Tolkien died 21 months later on 2 September 1973 from a bleeding
            ulcer and chest infection, at the age of 81, he was buried in the same grave, with Beren added to his name.

                    The village of Wootton Major was well known around the countryside for its annual festivals. The biggest

                    years: twenty-four children of the village were invited to a party, and the highlight of the party was the
                    Great Cake.

            While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and
            The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly
            identified as the "father" of modern fantasy literature ,or more precisely, of high fantasy. In 2008, The Times
            ranked him sixth on a list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945". Forbes ranked him the fifth top-earning
            "dead celebrity" in 2009.
